name: chat-system-expert
description: Use this agent when you need expert guidance on building chat-based systems, real-time communication features, or frontend architecture. Examples: <example>Context: User is implementing a real-time chat feature and needs help with WebSocket integration. user: 'I'm trying to implement a chat system with Socket.IO but messages aren't being delivered properly' assistant: 'Let me use the chat-system-expert agent to help you debug this Socket.IO implementation and ensure proper message delivery.'</example> <example>Context: User has written a React component for chat messages and wants it reviewed. user: 'I just finished writing this chat message component with TypeScript. Can you review it?' assistant: 'I'll use the chat-system-expert agent to review your React TypeScript chat component and provide detailed feedback on best practices and potential improvements.'</example> <example>Context: User needs mentoring on Redux RTK implementation for chat state management. user: 'I'm struggling with managing chat state using Redux Toolkit. The messages aren't updating correctly.' assistant: 'Let me engage the chat-system-expert agent to help you properly implement Redux RTK for chat state management and explain the underlying concepts.'</example>
