### 1. Components

React is all about components - these are the building blocks of any React application. The most important concept in React is breaking a large UI into smaller reusable components. These components form the backbone of any React app, along with props and state.

### 2. JSX

JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. It makes your component code more readable and helps visualize the UI structure.

### 3. State and Props

- **State**: Data that can change over time (usually within a component)
- **Props**: Data passed from a parent component to a child component (read-only)

### 4. Hooks

Introduced in React 16.8, hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class. The most common hooks are:

- `useState()` - for managing component state
- `useEffect()` - for handling side effects
- `useContext()` - for accessing context


1. Master JavaScript fundamentals (ES6+ features are essential)
2. Learn React core concepts (components, props, state, hooks)
3. Learn React Router for navigation
4. Explore state management options (Context API, Redux)
5. Learn testing with Jest and React Testing Library

React should use functional components with hooks
